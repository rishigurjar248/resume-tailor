      <h2>Billing issues</h2>
      <p>
        Contact <a href="mailto:resumelm@pm.me">resumelm@pm.me</a> as soon as possible if you believe a payment was duplicated, unauthorized, or otherwise incorrect. Include the billing email and relevant Stripe receipt information; do not send full card numbers.
      </p>
      <h2>Subscription cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        ResumeLM does not process payments or sell subscriptions, credits, or paid upgrades, so there are no purchases to refund.
      </p>
      <h2>Refund decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Refund requests are reviewed individually. ResumeLM does not currently advertise an automatic money-back guarantee. Approved refunds are returned through Stripe to the original payment method.
      </p>
    </LegalPage>
